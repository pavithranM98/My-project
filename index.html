          Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying
          unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
          Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
          health, and boosting your mood.
          <br />
          Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel
          overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out
          there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you
          a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the
          opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients
          have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall
          dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy
          diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever
          possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature
          made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and
          feel.
          <br />
          By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and
          learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet
          that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.

          <h3>Start Your Day Right</h3>
          <p>
            How you start each morning has a huge impact — positively or
            negatively — on the rest of your day. By practicing a healthy
            morning routine, you can increase your productivity, decrease
            stress, boost happiness and more.

        <h3>1. Set your alarm to work for you — not against you</h3>
        <img src="./image/alarm-clock-stock.webp" alt="clock-stock" />
        <p>
          The first step to kicking your day off right is adjusting your sleep
          schedule to ensure you have enough time in the morning for yourself
          and your responsibilities. If your kids get up at 6:30 a.m., this
          means getting up before them. Or, even if you don’t have kids or pets
          to care for, if you usually get up at 7 a.m. to scramble out the door
          by 7:30, it’s time for you to start your days earlier.
          <br />
          That said, sleep is important. When you adjust your alarm to wake up sooner, you also need to adjust your bedtime to turn in earlier. There is nothing healthy about being sleep deprived, so aim to get at least seven hours of sleep.
